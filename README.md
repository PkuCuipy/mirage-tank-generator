# Mirage-Tank-Generate
Mix 2 images A & B in a single PNG image M, 
where M will looks like A under the "black" background color, 
and looks like B under the white background color. 

Notes that you need to do some fine-tuning yourself (i.e. you need to modify the parameters in a GUI window), 
for it's not always possible to have the perfect M existed. 

## Usage:

1. Download this repository.
2. Make sure these dependencies exist:
    - PIL
    - NumPy
    - matplotlib
3. Run main.py
4. Drag 4 sliders below, until you are satisfied. (It might be slow due to poor coding though..)
